## Athlete Performance Visualization

This project provides a simple script to visualize an athlete's performance based on their participation in events and the medals they won. The script generates a bar chart summarizing:
- The number of events the athlete participated in.
- Whether they won medals or not (with a clear "No Medal" indicator if no medals were won).

### Features
- Displays the total number of events participated in by a specific athlete.
- Differentiates between athletes who have won medals and those who have not.
- Provides an easy-to-read bar chart visualization.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
